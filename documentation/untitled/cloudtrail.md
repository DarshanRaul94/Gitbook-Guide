# Cloudtrail

AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account**. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail.** 

{% hint style="info" %}
### Event

Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

**CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create it.** When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event. You can easily view recent events in the CloudTrail console by going to **Event history.**

### Trial

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can also deliver and analyze events in a trail with Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon CloudWatch Events. You can create a trail with the CloudTrail console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudTrail API.
