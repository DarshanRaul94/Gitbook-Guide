# ECS

**Fargate**:

AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to **run** [**containers**](https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers) **without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances**. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing.
