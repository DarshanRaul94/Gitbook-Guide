## Why AWS CDK:

 _AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) :_

So Cloudformation does still have two disadvantages over terraform 

1. Closed Source
2. AWS provider native

> But the biggest disadvantaqe of not actually being  Infrastructure as CODE and state management. That's gone for good thanks to AWS CDK.

You can use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.

#### Advantages of AWS CDK:

* AWS CDK is **open source**
* Use logic \(if statements, for-loops, etc\) **FINALLY!!**
* object-oriented techniques to create a model of your system
* Organize your project into logical modules
* Share and reuse your infrastructure as a library
* Use your existing **code review workflow**
* State management \( **diff** against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change\)

> There is no charge for using the AWS CDK, however you might incur AWS charges forcreating or using AWS [chargeable resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources)

## Prerequisites:
