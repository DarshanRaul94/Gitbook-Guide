# Merging multiple repo's into one

So I am creating a gitfolio site which will display all my public repositories in a nice UI. While creating it I realized that there are a lot of single program repositories \(mostly written in python \) which can easily be merged into a single repository which I can name "python-scripts". These are the steps I followed:

### Creating the Main repository and cloning it :

![Created a  new repo in github where all the repo&apos;s will be stored](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

![Copy this URL ](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

![clone the repo in your machine](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2854%29.png)

Now we are going to use a new git concept called as "submodule" . More here :[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
