Using the above reference to implement pytest in my code. 

Iam currently working on my CLI application for AWS. But it is getting frustrating and  illogical to use 'print' to troubleshoot the code. Also as I plan to create a package out of this code ultimately , Hence I desperately needed to create some test scenarios and put them to 'test' :p

So here we go :

This is the code and I am going to start slow , add couple of tests and then ultimately will try to create a  total test coverage\("pretty sure there is a term for this which I dont know yet\)

First of all , I created a folder just for all the test files to reside in. Lets call it 'tests'
{% endhint %}
