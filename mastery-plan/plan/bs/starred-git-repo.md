# Starred Git repo

I had just started committing in Github because I wanted to backup my code. Yes it was 10-15 lines of code which I was super proud of \(I still am !\) and I did not want to lose them. It all started there. Its 4 months since then..Time just ran. I got hacked for 1000$ in an hour. The cloudformation template which I uploaded to my public repo had my AWS access key and secret access key. I never knew about all the privacy issue's. As I mentioned above, all I was doing it for was to backup my precious code. That event changed my whole learning track.

 After being hacked I expected myself to be in complete shock. Although I had in the back of my mind that AWS may have mercy and give some credits save me another huge debt \(Hi there education loan! \), which they eventually ended up doing \(Best customer care experience ever! Amazon deserves all their glory based on how they treat their customers\). But I can reveal now that I still was not angry at all. Rather I was in complete awe. Yup I had never in my wildest dream thought that someone is able to scan a stranger's git repo \(2 mins after it was pushed! \) and then extract specific keys from the code &gt; Use those keys to create IAM users with admin access &gt; Use those users to create 20 m5.xlarge instances &gt; IN EVERY REGION !

I was in utter shock and the only thought that kept going through my head was HOW . How did he do it ? and thus began my journey which is in my opinion still in its premature phase but I am assured its on the right path.

I came accross boto, played with it . Then used python gui packages to simply start servers by inserting the instance-id. I still remember the day I sent a pic of that to my colleagues ! I was so proud :\) 

**Then the gui was bothering me so I learnt angular to create a web interface ,**

 **used electron to make a desktop version of that,** 

**used native script to create a mobile app out of it &gt;** 

**created a backend api server for it &gt;** 

**containerized it &gt;** 

**made a kubernetes cluster to handle the requests &gt;** 

**converted the API into a serverless application &gt;** 

**created a cli interface to interact with AWS &gt;** 

**created a pip package for same**

and once again I am in utter shock. Never in my wildest dreams had I thought I would be capable of doing all of the above.. never. I had to break a lot of mental barriers to get them done. Coding errors were secondary, inculcating the belief that I actually can do it was the hardest part of the journey till now. 

and I got a star on one of repo's today. Ofcourse it made my day but moreover the emotions of joy and the sense of achievement which kicked in were well worth the wait :\) 

There's a lot to look forward to :

* I need to get over my impostor syndrome which is due to being overwhelmed by looking at SO MANY things I want to do in so little time
* Getting in to the habit of actually completing what I started
* Mastering the fundamentals along the way 

Many more. But the gist is: Today I thank the person who hacked me :\)
