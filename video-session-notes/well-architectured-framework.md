# Well Architectured Framework

It is a framework which helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads

5 pillars:

* **Security Pillar**
* **Operational Excellence Pillar**
* **Reliability Pillar**
* **Performance Efficiency Pillar**
* **Cost Optimization Pillar**

## Terms:

* A **component** is the **`code, configuration, and AWS Resources`** that together deliver against a requirement. 
* The term **workload** is used to identify a **`set of components that together deliver business value`**. 
* We think about **architecture** as being how components work together in a workload. How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams.
* **Milestones** mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle \(design, implementation, testing, go live, and in production\).
* Within an organization the **technology portfolio** is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.
